We shout all the time
You clasp something against your chest, as if to conceal it
Ignore the rules that bother you.
If you dream of breaking up your bruised legs ... get up, and take a step towards here.
And even if we manage to cross the winds in fury ... as we get closer to the ice sky ... we are lost.
We shout constantly.
Believing does not provide answers.
We must reveal our weaknesses and our wounds ... and continue the struggle, otherwise nothing will begin.
Knock down the door, and advance!
